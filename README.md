## 1. Introduction
Here, we will learn to calculate Free Energy using Free Enegy Perturbation technique. Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) technique in used a method for computing differences in free energy. This is method is often used in Molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo simulations. We can obtain the theoretical formulation for calculation from Stastical Mechanics.
